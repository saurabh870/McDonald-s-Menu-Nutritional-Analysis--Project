# McDonald-s-Menu-Nutritional-Analysis--Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the nutritional content of various McDonald's menu items. The dataset provides detailed information on calories, fat, protein, carbohydrates, and other key nutrients across a wide range of menu categories. The primary goal of this analysis is to deliver valuable insights that can benefit both the restaurantâ€™s customers and the organization itself. By understanding the nutritional profiles of menu offerings, customers can make more informed choices that align with their dietary preferences and health goals. For the restaurant, this analysis can help guide menu development strategies, enabling the introduction of healthier options and meeting diverse nutritional needs. Through a detailed examination of the data, the project will identify the menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts, as well as determine the average nutritional content across popular menu categories. This information will empower customers to make healthier decisions while allowing McDonald's to refine its menu offerings to better cater to its customer base.
